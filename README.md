# CIS---420

SQL code from CIS 420 Project

This is all the SQL code I contributed to the database of my team's project.

The database consists of 11 total tables.

Included in this code are:

CREATE Statements for creating tables,

INSERT Statements for inputting data,

CREATE Stored Procedures for creating a new Member, Manager, and/or Employee,

UPDATE Stored Procedures updating existing Members, Managers and/or Employees database,

VIEW Stored Procedures for viewing every Member, Manager, and/or Employee
